# Authentication Tests - Summary

## Overview

Comprehensive authentication tests have been added to PR #2 to verify Firebase Google Sign-In functionality using mocked Firebase Auth.

---

## MVP-Critical Tests (Must Pass for 24-Hour Checkpoint)

These tests are essential for MVP and must pass before proceeding to PR #3:

### 1. ‚úÖ Unit Tests: Core Auth Functions (`tests/unit/auth.test.ts`)

**What it tests:**
- ‚úÖ `signInWithGoogle()` - Successful Google sign-in
- ‚úÖ `signInWithGoogle()` - Handle popup closed by user error
- ‚úÖ `signInWithGoogle()` - Handle network error
- ‚úÖ `signOut()` - Successful sign-out
- ‚úÖ `signOut()` - Handle sign-out errors
- ‚úÖ `getCurrentUser()` - Returns user when signed in
- ‚úÖ `getCurrentUser()` - Returns null when not signed in

**Why critical:**
These are the core authentication functions required for MVP. Without working auth, users can't access the canvas.

**Time to implement:** ~20 minutes

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Integration Tests: AuthProvider (`tests/integration/authProvider.test.tsx`)

**What it tests:**
- ‚úÖ Loading state displays while auth initializes
- ‚úÖ Shows sign-in button when user is not authenticated
- ‚úÖ Shows user info when signed in
- ‚úÖ **Auth state persists on page refresh** (critical for MVP!)

**Why critical:**
The AuthProvider manages the entire app's authentication state. This test verifies that auth state persists across page refreshes - a core MVP requirement.

**Time to implement:** ~30 minutes

---

## Nice-to-Have Tests (Post-MVP)

These tests improve quality but aren't required for the 24-hour checkpoint:

### 3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Unit Tests: Error Handling (`tests/unit/authErrors.test.ts`)

**What it tests:**
- User-friendly error messages for common auth errors
- Identification of Firebase auth errors vs generic errors

**Why nice-to-have:**
Improves UX but not blocking for MVP. Can add after checkpoint.

**Time to implement:** ~15 minutes

---

### 4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Unit Tests: LoginButton Component (`tests/unit/LoginButton.test.tsx`)

**What it tests:**
- Button renders correctly
- Clicking button triggers sign-in
- Loading state during sign-in
- Error message display on failure

**Why nice-to-have:**
Component-level tests are good practice but the integration test covers the critical path.

**Time to implement:** ~15 minutes

---

## Test Setup

### Mock Firebase Auth (`tests/mocks/firebaseMock.ts`)

A reusable mock for Firebase authentication that:
- Mocks `signInWithPopup`, `signOut`, `onAuthStateChanged`
- Provides `createMockUser()` helper for consistent test data
- Can be imported and used in any auth test

**Benefits:**
- No need for actual Firebase connection in tests
- Tests run fast (<100ms each)
- Consistent mock data across all tests
- Easy to simulate error scenarios

---

## Running the Tests

### Run MVP-critical tests only:
```bash
# Core auth functions
npm test tests/unit/auth.test.ts

# Auth provider integration
npm test tests/integration/authProvider.test.tsx
```

### Run all auth tests:
```bash
npm test auth
```

### Expected output:
```
‚úì tests/unit/auth.test.ts (7 tests)
  ‚úì Authentication Service - MVP CRITICAL
    ‚úì signInWithGoogle (MVP) (3 tests)
    ‚úì signOut (MVP) (2 tests)
    ‚úì getCurrentUser (MVP) (2 tests)

‚úì tests/integration/authProvider.test.tsx (4 tests)
  ‚úì AuthProvider Integration - MVP CRITICAL
    ‚úì should render loading state initially
    ‚úì should render signed out state when no user
    ‚úì should render user info when signed in
    ‚úì should persist auth state on mount

Test Files: 2 passed (2)
Tests: 11 passed (11)
Duration: ~200ms
```

## Coverage Targets

### MVP Auth Coverage:
- ‚úÖ **Core Functions:** 100% coverage (signIn, signOut, getCurrentUser)
- ‚úÖ **AuthProvider:** >80% coverage
- ‚úÖ **Error Handling:** Basic error paths covered

### Post-MVP Coverage:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Error Messages:** User-friendly messages tested
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **UI Components:** LoginButton fully tested

---

## Integration with CI/CD

### Recommended GitHub Actions Workflow:

```yaml
name: Auth Tests

on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      - run: npm install
      - name: Run MVP-critical auth tests
        run: |
          npm test tests/unit/auth.test.ts
          npm test tests/integration/authProvider.test.tsx
      - name: Fail PR if tests don't pass
        if: failure()
        run: exit 1
```

---

## What Gets Tested vs Manual Testing

### ‚úÖ Automated Tests Cover:
- Sign-in success and error handling
- Sign-out functionality
- Current user state retrieval
- Auth state persistence across refreshes
- Loading states
- Error scenarios (popup closed, network error)

### üñ±Ô∏è Manual Testing Still Required:
- Actual Google OAuth flow (real Firebase console)
- UI/UX of sign-in popup
- User sees their actual Google profile photo
- Firebase Console shows the user record

---

## Common Test Failures & Fixes

### ‚ùå "mockSignInWithPopup is not a function"
**Fix:** Make sure you're importing from `'../mocks/firebaseMock'`

### ‚ùå "Cannot read property 'currentUser' of undefined"
**Fix:** Ensure Firebase mock is set up before running tests

### ‚ùå "Test timeout"
**Fix:** Add `await waitFor()` when testing async auth state changes

### ‚ùå "Auth state not persisting"
**Fix:** Check that `onAuthStateChanged` mock is calling the callback correctly

## Success Criteria for PR #2

Before merging PR #2 to main:

- [ ] ‚úÖ All 7 unit tests pass (auth.test.ts)
- [ ] ‚úÖ All 4 integration tests pass (authProvider.test.tsx)
- [ ] ‚úÖ Manual test: Can sign in with Google in browser
- [ ] ‚úÖ Manual test: User info displays in header
- [ ] ‚úÖ Manual test: Can sign out
- [ ] ‚úÖ Manual test: Auth persists on page refresh
- [ ] ‚úÖ No console errors

**Total MVP-critical test count:** 11 tests
**Expected test duration:** <300ms
**Minimum coverage for auth code:** >80%

## Time Budget

| Task | Time |
|------|------|
| Install test dependencies | 5 min |
| Create Firebase mock | 15 min |
| Write unit tests (auth.test.ts) | 20 min |
| Write integration tests (authProvider.test.tsx) | 30 min |
| Run and fix failing tests | 15 min |
| **Total MVP-critical** | **~85 min (~1.5 hours)** |
| Nice-to-have tests | +30 min |
| **Total with nice-to-have** | **~115 min (~2 hours)** |

## Benefits of This Testing Approach

1. **Fast Feedback:** Tests run in <300ms, much faster than manual testing
2. **Confidence:** Know auth works before proceeding to complex features
3. **Regression Prevention:** Won't accidentally break auth in future PRs
4. **Documentation:** Tests show how auth is supposed to work
5. **AI Verification:** Confirms AI-generated auth code works correctly
6. **MVP Gate:** Clear pass/fail criteria for 24-hour checkpoint

---

## Next Steps After PR #2

Once auth tests pass:

1. ‚úÖ Merge PR #2 to main
2. ‚úÖ Proceed to PR #3 (Canvas with Pan/Zoom)
3. ‚úÖ Use similar testing approach for each subsequent PR
4. ‚úÖ Maintain >70% test coverage throughout project

---

**Remember:** These tests are your safety net. When they pass, you have confidence that authentication works correctly and won't break as you add more features. This is especially valuable when working with AI-generated code!
