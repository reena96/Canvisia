## SLIDE 2: The Journey - From MVP to AI-Powered
**Title:** Evolution Timeline

**Content (3 columns):**

### MVP (PR1-9)
‚úÖ Infinite canvas
‚úÖ 10 shape types
‚úÖ Real-time collaboration
‚úÖ Multiplayer cursors
‚úÖ 60 FPS performance

### Enhancement (PR10)
‚úÖ Resize & Rotate
‚úÖ 8 resize handles
‚úÖ Multi-tab presence
‚úÖ 189 passing tests

### AI Revolution (PR13-16)
ü§ñ Meet Vega - AI Assistant
ü§ñ Natural language commands
ü§ñ Intelligent layout
ü§ñ RGB color matching

**Visual Elements:**
- Timeline arrow from left to right
- Icons for each phase (basic shapes ‚Üí tools ‚Üí AI brain)

**Speaker Notes (20 seconds):**
> "We started with a solid collaborative canvas - real-time sync, smooth performance. PR10 added professional editing tools. But the real breakthrough came with PR13-16, where we introduced Vega, our AI assistant powered by Claude 3.5 Sonnet."

## SLIDE 3: Key Innovations
**Title:** What Makes Vega Different

**Content (2x2 grid):**

### 1. RGB Distance Algorithm
**The Problem:** Users create shapes in millions of colors
**Our Solution:** Mathematical fuzzy matching in 3D RGB space
**Result:** "Move the red circle" works for ANY shade of red

### 2. Multi-User AI Lock
**The Problem:** Conflicting AI commands from multiple users
**Our Solution:** Firestore-based distributed lock system
**Result:** Zero conflicts, even with 10+ users

### 3. Intelligent Shape ID
**The Problem:** Users don't know element IDs
**Our Solution:** "The blue rectangle" finds it automatically
**Result:** Natural language, no technical knowledge needed

### 4. Sub-2 Second Response
**The Problem:** AI feels slow if it takes >2s
**Our Solution:** Optimized pipeline (Claude API + Firestore)
**Result:** 90th percentile: 1.7 seconds total

**Visual Elements:**
- Icons for each innovation (color wheel, lock, magnifying glass, stopwatch)
- Color-coded boxes

**Speaker Notes (30 seconds):**
> "Four key technical innovations power Vega. First, our RGB distance algorithm handles infinite color variations - it finds 'the red circle' even if the color is #FF6B6B, not exactly red. Second, our multi-user lock prevents conflicts when multiple people use AI simultaneously. Third, intelligent shape identification means users can say 'the blue rectangle' instead of remembering IDs. And fourth, we optimized the entire pipeline to respond in under 2 seconds."

## SLIDE 4: Real-World Impact
**Title:** What This Means for Users

**Content (Visual comparison - Before/After):**

### Before AI (Manual)
‚ùå Click Rectangle tool
‚ùå Click 9 times to create shapes
‚ùå Drag each shape individually
‚ùå Align manually (tedious)
‚è±Ô∏è **Time: 2-3 minutes**

### After AI (Vega)
‚úÖ "Create a login form"
‚úÖ "Arrange all shapes in a grid"
‚úÖ "Align everything to the left"
‚è±Ô∏è **Time: 10 seconds**

**Bottom Stats Bar:**
- üöÄ **10x faster** layout creation
- üß† **Zero learning curve** - just describe what you want
- üë• **300+ tests** - production-ready quality
- ‚ö° **<2s response** - feels instant

**Visual Elements:**
- Split screen: left side shows manual clicking, right side shows chat interface
- Large "10x" badge

**Speaker Notes (15 seconds):**
> "The impact is dramatic. What used to take 2-3 minutes of clicking and dragging now takes 10 seconds of natural language. Users don't need to learn tools - they just describe what they want. And with 300+ passing tests, it's production-ready. Now let me show you how it works..."

## BONUS SLIDE (Optional): Technical Stack
**Title:** Built With Modern Tech

**Content (Icon grid):**
- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Canvas:** Konva.js (2D rendering)
- **Database:** Firebase (Firestore + RTDB)
- **AI:** Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Anthropic)
- **State:** Zustand
- **Testing:** Vitest (300+ tests)

**Performance Highlights:**
- ‚úÖ 0ms optimistic updates
- ‚úÖ 60 FPS canvas rendering
- ‚úÖ 66% Firestore write reduction
- ‚úÖ Infinite canvas, constant memory

**Speaker Notes (optional, if asked):**
> "Quick tech overview: React + TypeScript frontend, Konva for canvas rendering, Firebase for real-time sync, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet for AI. We use optimistic updates for zero-latency interactions, and the infinite canvas uses viewport culling to maintain constant memory usage."
