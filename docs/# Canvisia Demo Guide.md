## Introduction

**Canvisia** is an AI-powered collaborative canvas application that combines real-time multiplayer editing with intelligent natural language commands. Think Figma meets ChatGPT – users can create, manipulate, and arrange visual content through both direct manipulation and conversational AI.

**Core Innovation:** Instead of clicking through menus and tools, users can simply tell Vega (the AI assistant) what they want: "create a login form", "arrange all shapes in a grid", "move the blue circle to the center."

---

## What is Canvisia?

### Elevator Pitch
> "Canvisia is a collaborative canvas where teams can design together in real-time. What makes it unique is Vega, our AI assistant that understands natural language – you can create entire layouts just by describing what you want."

### Key Value Propositions
1. **AI-Accelerated Design** - Create complex layouts 10x faster with natural language
2. **Real-Time Collaboration** - See teammates' cursors, changes sync instantly
3. **Zero Learning Curve** - Just describe what you want, AI handles the technical details
4. **Intelligent Shape Manipulation** - AI identifies shapes by description ("the blue rectangle")

---

## AI Canvas Agent Overview

### Meet Vega 🤖

**Vega** is Canvisia's AI canvas assistant, powered by Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Vega understands natural language and can:
- Create shapes and diagrams from descriptions
- Manipulate existing elements intelligently
- Arrange and organize canvas layouts
- Build complex multi-element structures

### How Vega Works

```
User Command → Multi-User Lock → Claude API → Tool Execution → Canvas Update
     ↓              ↓                 ↓             ↓              ↓
"Create a      Prevents         Understands    Calls          Real-time
 login form"   conflicts        intent         create_shape   sync to all
                                                              users
```

**Key Technical Features:**
- **Multi-User Coordination**: Lock system prevents conflicting AI commands when multiple users are editing
- **Intelligent Shape Identification**: Vega finds shapes by description ("blue circle", "red rectangle") without needing IDs

## Technical Highlights

### Architecture Innovations

#### 1. RGB Distance-Based Color Matching
**Problem:** Users can create shapes with any of 16.7 million colors. Exact hex matching fails.

**Solution:** Mathematical fuzzy matching
```typescript
function colorDistance(hex1: string, hex2: string): number {
  const rgb1 = hexToRgb(hex1)
  const rgb2 = hexToRgb(hex2)

  // Euclidean distance in 3D RGB space
  return Math.sqrt(
    (rgb1.r - rgb2.r)² +
    (rgb1.g - rgb2.g)² +
    (rgb1.b - rgb2.b)²
  )
}
```

**Result:** Handles infinite color variations without manual enumeration.

---

#### 2. Connection-Based Presence System
**Problem:** Traditional presence (one entry per user) fails when user has multiple tabs.

**Old Approach:**
```
presence/{userId} = { isActive: true }
❌ Opening second tab doesn't create second entry
❌ Closing one tab marks user offline
```

**New Approach:**
```
presence/{userId} = { isActive: true }
connections/{userId}/{connectionId} = { connectedAt: timestamp }
✅ Each tab = unique connectionId
✅ User offline only when ALL connections close
```

**Result:** Perfect multi-tab support with automatic cleanup.

---

#### 3. Multi-User AI Lock System
**Problem:** Concurrent AI commands cause conflicts and race conditions.

**Solution:** Firestore-based distributed lock
```typescript
// Acquire lock
await setDoc(lockRef, {
  userId: currentUser.id,
  userName: currentUser.name,
  timestamp: Date.now(),
  command: userCommand
})

// Execute command
await executeAICommand(...)

// Release lock
await deleteDoc(lockRef)
```

**Features:**
- 10-second timeout (auto-release)
- Visual feedback ("AI being used by...")
- Queue or blocking for waiting users

**Result:** Zero conflicts even with 10+ simultaneous users.

---

#### 4. Modular AI Services Architecture

**Instead of monolithic `claude.ts`:**
```
src/services/ai/
├── client.ts       - Claude API communication
├── orchestrator.ts - Command coordination
├── executor.ts     - Tool execution
├── context.ts      - State summarization
├── tools.ts        - Tool definitions
└── lock.ts         - Multi-user sync
```

**Benefits:**
- Testable in isolation
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to extend with new tools
- Better code organization

---

#### 5. Optimistic Updates + Throttled Sync

**Problem:** Dragging shapes generates 100+ Firestore writes/second.

**Solution:** Local optimistic updates + throttled persistence
```typescript
// Immediate UI update (no Firestore)
updateShapeLocal(shapeId, { x: newX, y: newY })

// Throttled Firestore sync (max 20/sec)
updateShapeThrottled(shapeId, { x: newX, y: newY })

// Final position guaranteed persisted
await updateShape(shapeId, { x: finalX, y: finalY })
```

**Result:**
- Smooth 60fps dragging
- Reduced Firestore quota usage
- Guaranteed eventual consistency

---

### Development Best Practices

#### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- **Write tests first** - Then implement features
- **300+ tests** - Unit + integration coverage
- **All PRs tested** - No merge without passing tests
- **Edge cases** - Empty arrays, single items, null values

#### Immutable Operations
```typescript
// ✅ Good - Creates new array
const aligned = shapes.map(s => ({ ...s, x: newX }))

// ❌ Bad - Mutates original
shapes.forEach(s => s.x = newX)
```

#### Null Safety
```typescript
// ✅ Good - Optional chaining
const userName = user?.displayName ?? user?.email?.split('@')[0] ?? 'Anonymous'

// ❌ Bad - Runtime errors
const userName = user.displayName || user.email.split('@')[0]
```

#### Comprehensive Logging
```typescript
// Structured logging with prefixes
console.log('[AI Helpers] Aligning 10 shapes to left')
console.log('[Firestore] Shape abc123 modified: x=150, y=200')
console.log('[Executor] arrange_elements completed')
```

**Benefit:** Filter console by `[AI Helpers]` to trace AI operations.

### Lessons Learned (From Bugfix Docs)

#### From PR4 (Cursors):
> **Firebase Rules:** Database rules are deployed separately (`firebase deploy --only database`), not with app code. Rules don't cascade - they must be at the exact level where data is accessed.

> **SDK Versions Matter:** Firebase v9+ modular SDK has different patterns. `onValue()` returns an unsubscribe function - don't use legacy `off()` method.

#### From PR5 (Object Sync):
> **Event Bubbling:** When child and parent components both handle the same event type (drag), always prevent bubbling (`e.cancelBubble = true`) to avoid double-movement.

> **Single Source of Truth:** When multiple components need the same data (like user colors), create a shared configuration file. Follow DRY principle.

#### From PR6 (Optimization):
> **Optimistic Updates Are Non-Negotiable:** In real-time collaborative apps, optimistic updates are required, not optional. 50-200ms lag feels sluggish - users blame your app, not their network.

> **Event Bubbling Trade-offs:** When you prevent bubbling, you own ALL the side effects. Must manually handle cursor tracking, analytics, etc.

#### From PR7 (Presence):
> **Database Rules Deployment:** Always deploy database rules immediately after adding new RTDB paths. Test with actual Firebase, not just mocks.

> **Auto-Dismiss Timers:** Use `useEffect` cleanup to clear timers for toast notifications, hints, and temporary UI states.

#### From PR8 (Navigation):
> **Guard All Async Hooks:** React hooks run immediately, but async data (auth, database) isn't ready yet. Always add guards: `if (!userId) return`

> **UX Sensitivity Requires Iteration:** You can't get interaction sensitivity (scroll speed, zoom rate) right on first try. Test, adjust, repeat.

#### From PR9 (Text/Shapes):
> **Konva Coordinate System:** All shapes should use Konva's relative coordinate system. For lines: `points` should be relative to (x, y), not absolute coordinates.

> **Component Lifecycle Cleanup:** Don't rely solely on `onDisconnect()` for critical cleanup. Export cleanup functions and call them explicitly before sign out and on unmount.

#### From PR10 (Resize/Rotate):
> **Multi-Tab Lesson:** Reference counting is essential for presence. User should be marked offline only when ALL connections close, not when ANY connection closes.

#### From PR15 (AI Manipulation):
> **Critical Insight:** When dealing with user-generated content, systems must handle **infinite variation**, not **finite enumeration**. Fuzzy matching using mathematical distance metrics (RGB, HSL) is superior to exact matching or manual enumeration.

#### From PR16 (AI Layout):
> **Debugging Wisdom:** Not all console errors matter. CORS warnings during dev can be benign. Focus on functional tests over console cleanliness.

> **Immutable Operations:** Always create new arrays/objects instead of mutating. Prevents subtle state bugs in React and makes debugging easier.
