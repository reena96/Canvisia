# AI-First Development Process

**Project:** Canvisia - Real-time Collaborative Canvas
---
## 1. AI Tools & Workflow

1. **ChatGPT** - Architecture planning and decision-making
2. **Claude Code** - All implementation (100% of code written)
3. **Superpowers Plugin** - Enhanced Claude Code with structured workflows
   - `/superpowers:brainstorm` - Design refinement
   - `/superpowers:execute-plan` - Controlled implementation with review checkpoints
   - TDD, Debugging, and Testing skills
---

## 2. Development Approach

### Phase 1: Planning (70-80% of Day 1)
- Extensive upfront planning before any code
- Iterative clarification: "What are you confused about?"
- Clear scope definition: What it IS and ISN'T
- **Result:** Zero backtracking during implementation

### Phase 2: Implementation (Remaining time)
- Claude Code wrote 100% of code
- Human provided: direction, requirements, UX feedback, testing
- Frequent deployment and validation
- **Result:** 63/63 tests passing, production-ready MVP

---

**Workflow:**
1. Human defines requirements ‚Üí 2. AI generates implementation plan ‚Üí 3. AI writes code/tests ‚Üí 4. AI runs tests and fixes errors ‚Üí 5. AI commits to git ‚Üí 6. Human reviews and provides feedback

**Integration:** Claude Code had full repository access, executing bash commands, reading/writing files, and managing version control autonomously.

---

## 3. Prompting Strategies

**Most Effective Prompts:**

1. I made Claude document the blockers that were fixed in https://github.com/reena96/Canvisia/tree/main/docs/bugfix. For future PR's, keeping track of design decisions, mistakes made in the past and learnings helped with reducing issues. By documenting key issues, RCA's, resolutions and learnings, I was able to avoid such mistakes later on.
**"Let's implement PR #7 in TASK_LIST_WITH_TESTS.md. Use your superpowers (skills). Keep in mind the issues we've had so far, which are documented in https://github.com/reena96/Canvisia/tree/main/docs/bugfix. Focus only on PR #7. Do not focus on future PR's. Don't break exisiting design, unless it is an agreed upon design change."**

2. When the MVP deadline was extended by a day, I wanted to implement text formatting and text styling that was not part of my original plan. So for that, I used the /brainstorm feature of superpowers. At each key decision point, it asked me for questions, clarifying questions. During this phase, there was no code being written. Once we agreed on a plan, we could proceed to writing the plan and then executing it.


**Key Pattern:** Be specific about the problem/goal, but trust AI to determine implementation details.

## 4. Code Analysis

**AI-Generated with prompting:** 98% of codebase
- All React components, hooks, and utilities
- All Firebase integration (real-time sync, auth, presence)
- All tests (128 unit tests, 100% passing)
- All TypeScript configuration

**Human-Written:** 2% of codebase
- Firebase rules to force it do what I want more precisely.
- UI/UX feedback when I came across awkward UI issues.

**Metrics:** 15 commits, ~3,500 lines of code, 24-hour development time

## 5. Strengths & Limitations

**Where AI Excelled:**
- ‚úÖ Boilerplate generation (TypeScript configs, Firebase setup)
- ‚úÖ Pattern consistency (React hooks, state management)
- ‚úÖ Test-driven development (caught regressions automatically)
- ‚úÖ Error resolution (fixed 10 type errors in one session)
- ‚úÖ Documentation (clear commit messages, inline comments)
- ‚úÖ Feature implementation (text formatting keyboard shortcuts: Cmd+B/I/U)

**Where AI Struggled:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Design decisions (needed guidance on zoom limits: 0.01-256x ‚Üí 0.1-5x)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è UX intuition (toolbar layout, icon clarity required human input)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è External research (couldn't find Figma's exact zoom specifications)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Resource awareness (didn't initially consider Firebase free tier limits)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Context persistence (occasionally forgot previous session decisions)

**Where Human Developer Excelled:**
- üìã Planning & Architecture (70-80% upfront time investment)
- üéØ Requirement Clarification (identified AI confusion, corrected early)
- üé® UX Vision ("Make it like Figma", guided to professional quality)
- ‚úÖ Testing & Validation (caught deployment issues, verified production sync)
- üéöÔ∏è Scope Management (resisted feature creep, prioritized core features)
- üîß Tool Configuration (Firebase setup, API keys, Claude Code permissions)
- üîç Code Reading & Debugging (understood generated code while debugging and made Claude document our learnings in docs/bugfix)

## 6. Debugging Journey

**PR #1-2:** Smooth sailing (setup, auth)
**PR #4:** First major challenges - Firebase rules, cursor cleanup, SDK versions
**PR #5+:** Event handling, performance, UX polish

**Key Insight:** From PR #4 onwards, human code reading became critical for debugging production issues AI couldn't observe. Every bug documented in [docs/bugfix](https://github.com/reena96/Canvisia/tree/main/docs/bugfix).

## 7. Key Learnings

1. **Heavy upfront planning** (70-80%) eliminated backtracking
2. **Iterative clarification** aligned AI understanding with intent
3. **Clear scope boundaries** prevented feature creep
4. **Explicit tech choices** accelerated implementation
5. **Frequent validation** caught issues early
6. **Frequent commits to Github** VCS enables experimentation just like in traditional software engineering. Same principles apply.
7. **Code reading skills** enabled effective debugging
8. **Prompt Precision Matters:** "Remove toggle buttons" (clear) vs. "Make toolbar better" (vague) ‚Äî specificity drives accuracy.
9. **Tests Amplify AI Effectiveness:** With 128 tests as guardrails, AI refactored fearlessly. Zoom limit changes broke 6 tests, caught immediately.
10. **Documentation Accelerates Iteration:** It also helps with future context for design decisions both for me as a developer and for Claude. AI-maintained task lists, Root cause analysis and commit logs made resuming work after breaks seamless.
11. **Human Role is Strategic:** AI excels at implementation; humans excel at planning, requirements, UX vision, and validation.

## Conclusion

AI can generate more than 95% of code when guided by clear requirements and iterative feedback. Success requires:
- Heavy planning investment
- Specific prompts with clear goals
- Test-driven development as safety net
- Human validation of UX and architecture

**Result:** Fully functional collaborative canvas in 24 hours vs. estimated 1-2 weeks manual development.
