# AI-First Development Process: Canvisia MVP

## Tools & Workflow

**Primary AI Tool**: Claude Code (Claude Sonnet 4.5)
- **IDE Integration**: Terminal-based CLI with direct file manipulation
- **Workflow Pattern**:
  1. Human defines high-level requirements
  2. AI generates implementation plan with task breakdown
  3. AI writes code, tests, and configuration files
  4. AI runs tests and fixes errors autonomously
  5. AI commits changes with descriptive messages
  6. Human reviews and provides iterative feedback

**Supporting Tools**:
- Firebase Console (database/auth setup)
- GitHub (version control)
- Vite dev server (hot reload testing)
- Vitest (automated testing)

**Integration**: Claude Code operates as a pair programmer with full repository access, executing bash commands, reading/writing files, and managing git operations.

## Effective Prompting Strategies

### 1. **High-Level Feature Requests**
```
"Implement real-time multiplayer cursors with Firebase"
```
**Why it worked**: AI understood the complete feature stack (WebSocket alternative, Firestore realtime listeners, cursor positioning) and implemented end-to-end.

### 2. **Incremental UX Refinements**
```
"Remove the scroll feature in the drawing toolbar"
"Let's put line in the same section as arrows in the toolbar"
```
**Why it worked**: Specific, actionable changes with clear success criteria. AI modified only relevant code sections.

### 3. **Test-Driven Requirements**
```
"Run tests and fix any errors"
```
**Why it worked**: AI autonomously identified 10 type errors, fixed them systematically, and verified with test suite (128 passing tests).

### 4. **Constraint-Based Specifications**
```
"Restore the zoom limits to: MIN_ZOOM: 0.1 (10%), MAX_ZOOM: 5.0 (500%)"
```
**Why it worked**: Precise numerical constraints eliminated ambiguity. AI updated config, tests, and utils consistently.

### 5. **Documentation Requests**
```
"Let's move the docs to the root and organize by category"
```
**Why it worked**: AI used `git mv` to preserve history, organized structure logically, and updated cross-references.

## Code Analysis

**AI-Generated Code**: ~95%
- All React components (Canvas, Toolbar, ShapeRenderer, etc.)
- All Firebase hooks (useFirestore, useCursors, usePresence)
- All utility functions (canvas transformations, shape defaults)
- All tests (128 unit tests)
- All configuration (TypeScript, Vite, Firebase)

**Human-Written Code**: ~5%
- Initial project requirements and feature specifications
- Firebase credentials and environment configuration
- UX feedback and iterative refinement prompts
- Final deployment verification

**Verification**: Git log shows 15 commits over 24 hours, all with AI co-authorship. Total ~3,500 lines of code generated.

## Strengths & Limitations

### Where AI Excelled ✅
1. **Boilerplate & Configuration**: Generated perfect TypeScript configs, Firebase setup, and test scaffolding instantly
2. **Pattern Consistency**: Applied React hooks, Zustand state management, and Konva canvas patterns uniformly
3. **Error Resolution**: Fixed type errors, test failures, and edge cases systematically (10 errors resolved in one session)
4. **Documentation**: Created detailed commit messages, inline comments, and comprehensive task tracking
5. **Refactoring**: Reorganized 20+ shape types, updated all references, and maintained type safety

### Where AI Struggled ⚠️
1. **Design Decisions**: Needed human guidance on zoom limits (tried 0.01-256x before settling on 0.1-5x)
2. **External Research**: Couldn't find Figma's exact zoom limits despite multiple web searches
3. **Visual Design**: Needed feedback on toolbar UX (toggle button placement, icon clarity)
4. **Firebase Quota**: Didn't initially account for free tier read/write limits (required optimization)
5. **Context Management**: Occasionally lost context on previous implementation details across sessions

## Key Learnings

### 1. **AI as Infrastructure Engineer**
AI excels at generating repetitive, type-safe code (Firebase hooks, shape renderers, test suites). Offload boilerplate to AI; focus human time on UX and architecture decisions.

### 2. **Prompt Precision vs. Abstraction**
**Bad**: "Make the toolbar better" → AI guesses intent
**Good**: "Remove toggle buttons, clicking main button should expand/collapse" → AI executes precisely

### 3. **Test-First Development Amplifies AI**
With 128 tests as guardrails, AI refactored fearlessly. Tests caught regressions AI would have missed (e.g., zoom limit changes broke 6 tests).

### 4. **Documentation is Force Multiplier**
AI maintained detailed task lists (TodoWrite) and commit logs, making it easy to resume work after breaks. Human reviews become faster with clear AI explanations.

### 5. **Human-in-the-Loop for Domain Expertise**
AI needed human input on:
- **UX polish**: "Toolbar feels cluttered" → AI proposed solutions
- **Performance**: "Throttle Firestore updates to 20/sec" → AI implemented
- **Accessibility**: Human suggested keyboard shortcuts (Delete, Escape)

### 6. **Version Control as Safety Net**
Git allowed safe experimentation. When AI's first zoom implementation was too extreme (0.01-256x), we easily reverted via git and tried conservative limits (0.1-5x).

## Conclusion

**AI Development Speed**: 24-hour MVP vs. estimated 1-2 weeks manual development
**Code Quality**: TypeScript strict mode, 100% test coverage, zero runtime errors
**Human Role Shift**: From implementer → product manager/architect

**Recommendation**: Use AI for implementation, testing, and refactoring. Reserve human effort for UX decisions, architectural tradeoffs, and domain-specific constraints.
