# AI-First Development Process

**Project:** Canvisia - Real-time Collaborative Canvas
**Timeline:** 24-hour MVP sprint
**Result:** Production-ready application with 8/8 requirements met

---

## 1. Tools & Workflow

**AI Tool:** Claude Code (Sonnet 4.5) via terminal CLI

**Workflow:**
1. Human defines requirements → 2. AI generates implementation plan → 3. AI writes code/tests → 4. AI runs tests and fixes errors → 5. AI commits to git → 6. Human reviews and provides feedback

**Integration:** Claude Code had full repository access, executing bash commands, reading/writing files, and managing version control autonomously.

## 2. Prompting Strategies

**Most Effective Prompts:**

1. **"Implement real-time multiplayer cursors with Firebase"**
   High-level feature request. AI understood entire stack and implemented end-to-end.

2. **"Restore the zoom limits to: MIN_ZOOM: 0.1 (10%), MAX_ZOOM: 5.0 (500%)"**
   Precise constraints eliminated ambiguity. AI updated config, tests, and utils consistently.

3. **"Run tests and fix any errors"**
   Test-driven approach. AI autonomously identified 10 type errors and fixed them systematically.

4. **"Remove toggle buttons, clicking main button should expand/collapse"**
   Clear UX requirement. AI modified only relevant code sections without over-engineering.

5. **"Let's put line in the same section as arrows in the toolbar"**
   Simple organizational improvement. AI reorganized toolbar logic and maintained consistency.

**Key Pattern:** Be specific about the problem/goal, but trust AI to determine implementation details.

## 3. Code Analysis

**AI-Generated:** ~95% of codebase
- All React components, hooks, and utilities
- All Firebase integration (real-time sync, auth, presence)
- All tests (128 unit tests, 100% passing)
- All TypeScript configuration

**Human-Written:** ~5%
- Requirements and feature specifications
- Firebase project setup and credentials
- UX feedback ("make it more like Figma")
- Production testing and validation

**Metrics:** 15 commits, ~3,500 lines of code, 24-hour development time

## 4. Strengths & Limitations

**Where AI Excelled:**
- ✅ Boilerplate generation (TypeScript configs, Firebase setup)
- ✅ Pattern consistency (React hooks, state management)
- ✅ Test-driven development (caught regressions automatically)
- ✅ Error resolution (fixed 10 type errors in one session)
- ✅ Documentation (clear commit messages, inline comments)
- ✅ Feature implementation (text formatting keyboard shortcuts: Cmd+B/I/U)

**Where AI Struggled:**
- ⚠️ Design decisions (needed guidance on zoom limits: 0.01-256x → 0.1-5x)
- ⚠️ UX intuition (toolbar layout, icon clarity required human input)
- ⚠️ External research (couldn't find Figma's exact zoom specifications)
- ⚠️ Resource awareness (didn't initially consider Firebase free tier limits)
- ⚠️ Context persistence (occasionally forgot previous session decisions)

## 5. Key Learnings

**Where Human Developer Excelled:**
- 📋 **Planning & Architecture** - 70-80% time invested in upfront planning eliminated backtracking
- 🎯 **Requirement Clarification** - Proactively identified AI confusion, corrected misunderstandings early
- 🎨 **UX Vision** - Clear direction ("Make it like Figma"), guided refinement to professional quality
- ✅ **Testing & Validation** - Caught deployment issues, tested multi-user scenarios, verified production sync
- 🎚️ **Scope Management** - Resisted feature creep, prioritized core features, deferred non-essential tools
- 🔧 **Tool Configuration** - Set up Firebase, managed API keys, configured Claude Code with proper permissions
- 🔍 **Code Reading & Debugging** - Read generated code to understand behavior, documented all debugging in docs/bugfix

**General Insights:**

1. **Prompt Precision Matters:** "Remove toggle buttons" (clear) vs. "Make toolbar better" (vague) — specificity drives accuracy.

2. **Tests Amplify AI Effectiveness:** With 128 tests as guardrails, AI refactored fearlessly. Zoom limit changes broke 6 tests, caught immediately.

3. **Version Control Enables Experimentation:** When AI's first zoom implementation was too extreme, git made reverting trivial.

4. **Documentation Accelerates Iteration:** AI-maintained task lists and commit logs made resuming work after breaks seamless.

## Conclusion

AI can generate 95% of code when guided by clear requirements and iterative feedback. Success requires:
- Heavy planning investment (70-80% upfront)
- Specific prompts with clear goals
- Test-driven development as safety net
- Human validation of UX and architecture

**Result:** Fully functional collaborative canvas in 24 hours vs. estimated 1-2 weeks manual development.
