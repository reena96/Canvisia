# PR #16 Validation Guide: AI Layout Commands

## Overview
PR #16 implements AI-powered layout and alignment commands for shapes:
- **arrange_elements**: Arrange shapes in grid, row, or column patterns
- **align_elements**: Align shapes (left, right, top, bottom, center)

## Prerequisites
1. Switch to the feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout feature/ai-layout
   ```

2. Start the development environment:
   ```bash
   npm run dev:full
   ```

3. Log in using Dev Login (alice@test.com / password123)

4. Open a canvas

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Grid Arrangement ✅
**Objective**: Verify shapes can be arranged in a grid pattern

**Steps**:
1. Create 4-6 shapes manually on the canvas (different types/sizes)
2. In the AI chat, type:
   ```
   Arrange all shapes in a grid
   ```

**Expected Result**:
- Shapes are arranged in a neat grid (approximately square)
- Spacing between shapes is even (default 20px)
- Grid layout makes sense for the number of shapes:
  - 4 shapes → 2x2 grid
  - 6 shapes → 2x3 or 3x2 grid
  - 9 shapes → 3x3 grid

**Validation**:
- [ ] Shapes arranged in grid pattern
- [ ] Even spacing between shapes
- [ ] No overlapping shapes
- [ ] Check console for: `[AI Helpers] Arranging N shapes in RxC grid`

   ```

**Expected Result**:
- All shapes aligned horizontally
- Y-coordinates are the same for all shapes
- Shapes spaced evenly left to right
- Order preserved from shape creation

**Validation**:
- [ ] All shapes on same horizontal line
- [ ] Even horizontal spacing
- [ ] Check console for: `[AI Helpers] Arranging N shapes in row`

**Expected Result**:
- All rectangles have same X coordinate (leftmost)
- Y positions remain unchanged
- Left edges perfectly aligned

**Validation**:
- [ ] All shapes aligned to leftmost X
- [ ] Y positions unchanged
- [ ] Check console for: `[AI Helpers] Aligning N shapes to left`

   ```

**Expected Result**:
- Right edges of all shapes aligned
- Y positions unchanged
- Accounts for different shape widths

**Validation**:
- [ ] Right edges aligned

## Known Limitations

1. **Circular arrangement**: Placeholder implementation (uses grid instead)
   - Noted in code: `// TODO: Implement circular arrangement in future PR`

2. **Animation**: Shapes jump to new positions (no smooth transition)
   - Could be enhanced in future PR

3. **Undo/Redo**: Not implemented yet
   - Will be part of future PR

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No matching shapes found"
**Solution**: Ensure shapes are created before running layout command

### Issue: Shapes overlap after arrangement
**Solution**: Check spacing value, may need to increase

### Issue: Layout doesn't execute
**Solution**:
1. Check AI lock status
2. Verify Firebase connection
3. Check console for errors

### Issue: Tests fail
**Solution**:
```bash
npm run seed-users  # Ensure test data exists
npm test -- --run   # Re-run tests
```
