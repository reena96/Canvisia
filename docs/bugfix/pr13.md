## Bugs & Fixes

### Bug #1: AI Response Not Updating "Processing..." Message

**Issue:**
When sending a message to the AI, the "Processing..." placeholder would remain even after the AI responded. Users would see stale "Processing..." text instead of the actual AI response.

**Root Cause:**
State update timing issue in the `AIChat` component:

1. User sends message → adds user message to state
2. Component adds "Processing..." AI message to state
3. `useAI` hook receives AI response via callback
4. Callback tries to update the "Processing..." message
5. **But**: React batching caused the update to target wrong message index

**Code Path:**
```typescript
// AIChat.tsx - Original problematic code
const handleAIMessage = (userMsg: string, aiResponse: string) => {
  setMessages(prev => {
    const lastAiMsg = prev.findLast(msg => msg.sender === 'ai')
    // This would sometimes find the wrong message!
    return prev.map(msg =>
      msg.id === lastAiMsg?.id ? { ...msg, text: aiResponse } : msg
    )
  })
}
```

**Why This Happened:**
- Using `findLast()` was unreliable with React's state batching
- Multiple "Processing..." messages could exist during rapid interactions
- No guaranteed way to identify which placeholder to update

**Fix:**
Check for the exact "Processing..." text AND ensure it's the last message:

```typescript
// AIChat.tsx - Fixed version
const handleAIMessage = (_userMsg: string, aiResponse: string) => {
  setMessages(prev => {
    // Find the index of the last "Processing..." message
    const index = prev.findIndex((msg, i) =>
      msg.sender === 'ai' &&
      msg.text === 'Processing...' &&
      i === prev.length - 1  // Only check the last message
    )

    if (index === -1) {
      console.warn('No Processing message found to update')
      return prev
    }

    // Create completely new array with updated message
    return prev.map((msg, i) =>
      i === index ? { ...msg, text: aiResponse } : msg
    )
  })
}
```

**Result:**
- ✅ AI responses now reliably replace "Processing..." placeholders
- ✅ Message updates are atomic and predictable
- ✅ Warning logged if placeholder not found (defensive)

---

### Bug #2: Markdown Syntax Visible in AI Messages

**Issue:**
AI responses containing markdown formatting showed raw syntax:
```
**Creating shapes** (with bold)
- **Adding text labels** (with bullet points)
```

Users saw `**bold**` and `- bullet` instead of proper formatting.

**Root Cause:**
The `AIChat` component rendered message text as plain strings:

```tsx
// AIChat.tsx - Original code
<div className="ai-chat-message-content">{msg.text}</div>
```

Plain text rendering doesn't interpret markdown - it displays it literally.

**Why This Happened:**
- Initial implementation focused on getting messages displayed
- Markdown rendering wasn't considered in MVP
- AI responses naturally use markdown for better readability

**Fix:**
Install `react-markdown` library and conditionally render AI messages:

```bash
npm install react-markdown
```

```tsx
// AIChat.tsx - Fixed version
import ReactMarkdown from 'react-markdown'

<div className="ai-chat-message-content">
  {msg.sender === 'ai' ? (
    <ReactMarkdown>{msg.text}</ReactMarkdown>
  ) : (
    msg.text
  )}
</div>
```

**Result:**
- ✅ **Bold text** renders properly
- ✅ Bullet lists are formatted correctly
- ✅ Links, code blocks, and other markdown work
- ✅ User messages stay as plain text (no unexpected formatting)

### Bug #3: Anonymous Users in Firebase

**Issue:**
Firebase Realtime Database and Firestore showed presence records for "Anonymous" users instead of proper display names (Alice, Bob, Charlie).

**Root Cause:**
Test users were created via Dev Login **before** their Firebase Auth displayNames were set:

1. Initial dev login users created with email/password only
2. Canvas component: `const userName = user?.displayName || 'Anonymous'`
3. Presence system stored "Anonymous" in Firebase
4. Old anonymous records persisted in database

**Why This Happened:**
- `signInWithEmailAndPassword()` doesn't automatically set displayName
- Test users needed explicit displayName configuration via Admin SDK
- Dev login was enabled before running `setup-prod-test-users.ts`

**Fix:**
1. Run `setup-prod-test-users.ts` to set displayNames:
```typescript
await auth.createUser({
  email: user.email,
  password: user.password,
  displayName: user.displayName,  // ← This was missing initially
  emailVerified: true,
})
```

2. Manually delete old anonymous records from Firebase
3. Update DevLogin component to use production test user emails

**Result:**
- ✅ Alice, Bob, Charlie now have proper displayNames in Firebase Auth
- ✅ All new presence records show "Alice (Test)", "Bob (Test)", "Charlie (Test)"
- ✅ No more anonymous users appearing
- ✅ Google OAuth users will always have displayNames (required by Google)

---

## Key Learnings

### 1. React State Updates Are Asynchronous
**Problem:** Trying to update specific array elements based on current state is error-prone.

**Solution:**
- Use `findIndex` with strict conditions (check index === length - 1)
- Create new arrays instead of mutating
- Add defensive warnings for unexpected states

**Takeaway:** Always assume state updates can batch and race. Design state updates to be idempotent.

---

### 2. Rich Text Requires Parsing Libraries
**Problem:** Displaying markdown as plain text loses all formatting.

**Solution:**
- Use `react-markdown` for AI messages (supports markdown)
- Keep user messages as plain text (prevent injection)
- Separate rendering logic based on message sender

**Takeaway:** Never assume users/AI will send plain text. Always sanitize and render appropriately.

---

### 3. displayName Must Be Explicitly Set for Email/Password Auth
**Problem:** `signInWithEmailAndPassword()` doesn't populate displayName automatically.

**Solution:**
- Use Firebase Admin SDK to set displayName during user creation
- Run setup scripts **before** enabling login features
- Add email fallback: `user.displayName || user.email?.split('@')[0] || 'Anonymous'`

**Takeaway:** Different auth methods have different user profile behaviors. Google OAuth auto-populates displayName, but email/password doesn't.

---

### 4. Environment Variables Are Compile-Time, Not Runtime
**Problem:** Confusion about whether `.env.local` is "deployed" to Firebase.

**Solution:**
- Environment variables are baked into JavaScript during `npm run build`
- `.env.local` files stay on local machine (gitignored)
- Each build environment needs its own `.env.local`

**Takeaway:** Build once per environment with appropriate env vars. The built JavaScript contains the values, not references to env files.

---

### 5. Multi-User Systems Need Locking Mechanisms
**Problem:** Multiple users sending AI commands simultaneously could conflict.

**Solution:**
- Implemented `aiLock` service using Firebase Realtime Database
- Lock includes: userId, userName, timestamp, command
- Lock automatically expires after timeout
- UI shows who currently has the lock

**Takeaway:** Even "simple" AI chat needs coordination in collaborative environments. Plan for concurrency from the start.

---

## Testing Notes

### Manual Testing Performed
1. ✅ Send message to AI → verify "Processing..." appears
2. ✅ Wait for response → verify "Processing..." updates to actual response
3. ✅ Check markdown formatting → bold, lists, links render correctly
4. ✅ Login as Alice/Bob/Charlie → verify names appear (not "Anonymous")
5. ✅ Check Firebase presence → confirm displayNames are correct
6. ✅ Multi-user test → verify AI lock prevents concurrent commands
7. ✅ Cmd+K shortcut → verify chat input focuses
8. ✅ Pin/unpin chat → verify positioning works
9. ✅ Minimize/maximize → verify UI state persists

### Production Deployment Testing
- ✅ Deployed to https://canvisia-ab47b-8ea82.web.app (development)
- ✅ Deployed to https://canvisia-ab47b.web.app (production)
- ✅ Both sites have Dev Login enabled
- ✅ All three test users work correctly

## Performance Considerations

### Bundle Size Impact
```
Before:  ~800 KB (gzipped)
After:   ~1,444 KB (gzipped)
Increase: +644 KB
```

**Contributors:**
- `@anthropic-ai/sdk`: ~400 KB
- `react-markdown`: ~120 KB
- AI service code: ~124 KB

**Mitigation Strategies for Future:**
- Consider code-splitting AI features
- Lazy load markdown renderer
- Move to server-side AI calls (removes SDK from client bundle)

---

## Security Considerations

### Current Implementation (Day 1)
⚠️ **Client-side API key** via environment variable
- API key visible in JavaScript bundle
- Acceptable for initial development
- **NOT suitable for production long-term**

### Future Improvements (PRs #14-17)
- Move AI calls to Firebase Cloud Functions
- Store API key server-side only
- Use Firebase Auth tokens for request authorization
- Rate limiting per user
