## Bugs & Fixes

### 1. Cursor Position Not Updating During Drag

**Issue:**
When dragging a shape, the shape's position updated smoothly, but the user's cursor position (the colored dot with name label) stayed frozen at the drag start position. Other users couldn't see where the dragging user's cursor actually was.

**Root Cause:**
Event bubbling prevention in `ShapeRenderer.tsx` blocked the Stage's `onMouseMove` handler from firing:

```typescript
// ShapeRenderer.tsx
const handleDragMove = (e: any) => {
  e.cancelBubble = true  // ← This prevents Stage from seeing the event!
  const node = e.target
  onDragMove?.(node.x(), node.y())
}
```

This `e.cancelBubble = true` was added in PR #5 to fix the viewport drift bug (shapes dragging the entire canvas). It successfully prevented the Stage from moving, but also prevented cursor tracking.

**Why Canvas.tsx's onMouseMove Wasn't Called:**

```typescript
// Canvas.tsx - This handler never fires during shape drag
<Stage onMouseMove={handleMouseMove}>  // ← Event never reaches here!
  {/* ... */}
</Stage>
```

**Fix:**
Manually update cursor position during shape drag in `handleShapeDragMove`:

```typescript
// Canvas.tsx
const handleShapeDragMove = useCallback(
  (shapeId: string, x: number, y: number) => {
    // Optimistic: update local state immediately
    updateShapeLocal(shapeId, { x, y })

    // Throttled: sync to Firestore (max 20 updates/sec)
    updateShapeThrottled(shapeId, { x, y })

    // Update cursor position during drag (since event bubbling is prevented)
    const stage = stageRef.current
    if (stage && user) {
      const pointerPosition = stage.getPointerPosition()
      if (pointerPosition) {
        const canvasPos = screenToCanvas(pointerPosition.x, pointerPosition.y, viewport)
        updateCursor(canvasPos.x, canvasPos.y)
      }
    }
  },
  [updateShapeLocal, updateShapeThrottled, user, viewport, updateCursor]
)
```

**File:** `src/components/canvas/Canvas.tsx:184-192`

**Lesson:** When preventing event bubbling, you must manually handle all side effects that would normally be triggered by parent handlers. Event bubbling prevention is a trade-off:
- **Benefit:** Prevents unwanted parent behavior (viewport drift)
- **Cost:** Breaks event-driven patterns that depend on bubbling
- **Solution:** Explicitly handle all necessary side effects in the handler where bubbling stops

---

## Design Decisions

### 1. Optimistic Updates Pattern

**Decision:** Update local state immediately, sync to Firestore asynchronously.

**Rationale:**
- Instant UI feedback (0ms perceived lag)
- Users see their actions immediately
- Network latency hidden from user experience
- Firestore sync happens in background

**Implementation:**

```typescript
// Local optimistic state
const [localShapeUpdates, setLocalShapeUpdates] = useState<Record<string, Partial<Shape>>>({})

// Merge Firestore shapes with local updates
const shapes = useMemo(() => {
  return firestoreShapes.map((shape) => ({
    ...shape,
    ...(localShapeUpdates[shape.id] || {}),
  }))
}, [firestoreShapes, localShapeUpdates])

// Update local state immediately
const updateShapeLocal = useCallback((shapeId: string, updates: Partial<Shape>) => {
  setLocalShapeUpdates((prev) => ({
    ...prev,
    [shapeId]: { ...(prev[shapeId] || {}), ...updates },
  }))
}, [])

// Clear local updates when Firestore syncs back
useMemo(() => {
  setLocalShapeUpdates((prev) => {
    const updated = { ...prev }
    firestoreShapes.forEach((shape) => {
      if (updated[shape.id]) {
        delete updated[shape.id]
      }
    })
    return updated
  })
}, [firestoreShapes])
```

**Benefits:**
- Zero perceived latency
- Smooth 60 FPS drag experience
- Network issues don't affect UI responsiveness
- Firestore becomes source of truth once synced

**Trade-offs:**
- Temporary local state can diverge from server
- Must handle sync-back correctly
- More complex state management

---

### 2. Throttling Strategy

**Decision:** Throttle Firestore updates to 20 updates per second (50ms interval).

**Rationale:**
- Mouse move events fire at ~60 FPS (every 16ms)
- Writing to Firestore every 16ms is wasteful and expensive
- 20 updates/sec provides smooth sync without excessive writes
- Final position always written on drag end (not throttled)

**Implementation:**

```typescript
// Throttled Firestore update function (50ms = 20 updates/sec)
const updateShapeThrottled = useMemo(
  () =>
    throttle((shapeId: string, updates: Partial<Shape>) => {
      updateShape(shapeId, updates).catch((error) => {
        console.error('Throttled shape update failed:', error)
      })
    }, 50), // 20 updates per second
  [updateShape]
)
```

**Why 50ms (20 updates/sec)?**
- Fast enough for smooth remote viewing (perceived as continuous)
- Slow enough to significantly reduce Firestore costs
- Final position written immediately on dragEnd guarantees accuracy

**Alternative Considered:**
- 100ms (10 updates/sec): Felt choppy for other users
- 16ms (60 updates/sec): Wasteful, no perceived benefit
- 50ms (20 updates/sec): Sweet spot ✅

---

### 3. Dual Drag Handlers (Move + End)

**Decision:** Separate handlers for `onDragMove` and `onDragEnd`.

**Rationale:**
- **onDragMove:** Optimistic update + throttled sync (frequent, non-critical)
- **onDragEnd:** Guaranteed final position (infrequent, critical)

**Implementation:**

```typescript
// During drag: optimistic + throttled
const handleShapeDragMove = useCallback(
  (shapeId: string, x: number, y: number) => {
    updateShapeLocal(shapeId, { x, y })          // Instant UI
    updateShapeThrottled(shapeId, { x, y })      // Background sync
    updateCursor(canvasPos.x, canvasPos.y)       // Cursor tracking
  },
  [updateShapeLocal, updateShapeThrottled, updateCursor]
)

// On drag end: ensure final position persisted
const handleShapeDragEnd = useCallback(
  async (shapeId: string, x: number, y: number) => {
    updateShapeLocal(shapeId, { x, y })
    await updateShape(shapeId, { x, y })  // Not throttled!
  },
  [updateShape, updateShapeLocal]
)
```

**Benefits:**
- Final position always accurate (not lost to throttling)
- Smooth updates during drag
- Network efficiency (throttled writes)
- Data integrity (final write guaranteed)

---

### 4. Test-Driven Development (TDD)

**Decision:** Write tests before implementation code.

**Approach:**
1. **RED:** Write failing test
2. **Verify RED:** Confirm test fails for right reason
3. **GREEN:** Write minimal code to pass
4. **Verify GREEN:** Confirm test passes
5. **REFACTOR:** Clean up while keeping tests green

**Example - Hit Testing:**

```typescript
// STEP 1: Write test first (RED)
it('should return true when point is inside rectangle', () => {
  const rect = { x: 0, y: 0, width: 100, height: 100 }
  expect(isPointInRectangle(50, 50, rect)).toBe(true)
})

// STEP 2: Verify it fails (module doesn't exist)
// Error: Failed to resolve import "@/utils/hitTesting"

// STEP 3: Implement minimal code (GREEN)
export function isPointInRectangle(px: number, py: number, rect: RectangleBounds): boolean {
  return px >= rect.x && px <= rect.x + rect.width && py >= rect.y && py <= rect.y + rect.height
}

// STEP 4: Verify it passes
// ✓ 5 tests passed
```

**Result:** All 60 tests passing throughout PR #6 development.

## Architecture Patterns

### 1. Optimistic Update Pattern

**Pattern:** Local state overlay on server state.

**Structure:**
```
Server State (Firestore) ──┐
                           ├──► Merged State ──► UI Rendering
Local State (Optimistic) ──┘

When Firestore syncs back ──► Clear local state
```

**Benefits:**
- Instant perceived performance
- Server remains source of truth
- Automatic conflict resolution (last write wins via timestamps)

---

### 2. Event Handler Composition

**Pattern:** Multiple concerns handled in single event.

```typescript
const handleShapeDragMove = (shapeId, x, y) => {
  updateShapeLocal(shapeId, { x, y })       // Concern 1: Local UI
  updateShapeThrottled(shapeId, { x, y })   // Concern 2: Remote sync
  updateCursor(canvasX, canvasY)            // Concern 3: Cursor tracking
}
```

**Lesson:** When event bubbling is prevented, compose all side effects in one handler.

---

### 3. Throttling with Final Write

**Pattern:** Throttle frequent updates, guarantee final value.

```typescript
// During operation: throttled
onDragMove: (x, y) => updateShapeThrottled(shapeId, { x, y })

// On completion: immediate
onDragEnd: (x, y) => await updateShape(shapeId, { x, y })
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduces API calls by 60-70%
- Maintains data integrity
- Smooth user experience

---

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Optimistic Updates

**Metric:** 0ms perceived latency for local user

Before PR #6:
```
User drags → Firestore write → Wait for response → UI updates
└─ 50-200ms latency ─┘
```

After PR #6:
```
User drags → UI updates instantly (local state)
           → Firestore write happens in background
```

---

### 2. Throttling

**Metric:** 66% reduction in Firestore writes

Without throttling (60 FPS):
```
60 writes/sec × 1 second drag = 60 writes
```

With throttling (20 updates/sec):
```
20 writes/sec × 1 second drag = 20 writes
+ 1 final write on dragEnd = 21 writes total
```

**Savings:** 39 writes saved per second of dragging (66% reduction)

---

### 3. Memoization

**Pattern:** Cache computed values and throttled functions.

```typescript
// Memoize merged shapes
const shapes = useMemo(() => {
  return firestoreShapes.map((shape) => ({
    ...shape,
    ...(localShapeUpdates[shape.id] || {}),
  }))
}, [firestoreShapes, localShapeUpdates])

// Memoize throttled function
const updateShapeThrottled = useMemo(
  () => throttle((shapeId, updates) => updateShape(shapeId, updates), 50),
  [updateShape]
)
```

**Benefits:**
- Prevents unnecessary re-renders
- Throttle function stable across renders
- React optimizations work correctly

---

## Testing Strategies

### 1. Unit Tests for Pure Functions

**Example:** `tests/unit/hitTesting.test.ts`

```typescript
describe('isPointInRectangle', () => {
  it('should return true when point is inside rectangle', () => {
    const rect = { x: 0, y: 0, width: 100, height: 100 }
    expect(isPointInRectangle(50, 50, rect)).toBe(true)
  })

  it('should handle edge cases', () => {
    const rect = { x: 0, y: 0, width: 100, height: 100 }
    expect(isPointInRectangle(0, 0, rect)).toBe(true)      // Top-left corner
    expect(isPointInRectangle(100, 100, rect)).toBe(true)  // Bottom-right corner
    expect(isPointInRectangle(101, 101, rect)).toBe(false) // Just outside
  })
})
```

**Coverage:** 5 tests covering happy path, edge cases, negative coordinates

---

### 2. Integration Tests for Firestore Sync

**Example:** `tests/integration/dragSync.test.ts`

```typescript
describe('Drag and Sync Integration', () => {
  it('should update shape position via updateShape', async () => {
    const { result } = renderHook(() => useFirestore('test-canvas-id'))

    await act(async () => {
      await result.current.updateShape('test-shape-1', { x: 200, y: 300 })
    })

    const { updateShape } = await import('@/services/firestore')
    expect(updateShape).toHaveBeenCalledWith('test-canvas-id', 'test-shape-1', {
      x: 200,
      y: 300,
    })
  })
})
```

**Coverage:** 2 integration tests verifying Firestore hook behavior

---

### 3. Manual Testing Checklist

**Test Scenarios:**

1. **Single User Drag**
   - [ ] Shape follows cursor smoothly (60 FPS)
   - [ ] No lag or jitter
   - [ ] Final position accurate after refresh

2. **Multi-User Drag Sync**
   - [ ] User A drags shape → User B sees it move (< 100ms)
   - [ ] Movement appears smooth (20 updates/sec is enough)
   - [ ] Cursor position syncs during drag (bug fix verified)

3. **Cursor Tracking During Drag**
   - [ ] User's cursor dot moves during shape drag (not frozen)
   - [ ] Name label follows cursor
   - [ ] Other users see cursor moving

4. **Simultaneous Edits**
   - [ ] User A drags shape left
   - [ ] User B drags same shape right (at same time)
   - [ ] Last drag wins (timestamp-based)
   - [ ] No crashes or conflicts

5. **Performance**
   - [ ] 60 FPS during drag (no frame drops)
   - [ ] CPU usage reasonable
   - [ ] Network traffic throttled (check browser DevTools)

## Key Learnings

### 1. Event Bubbling Trade-offs

**Lesson:** Preventing event bubbling solves one problem but creates others.

**PR #5:** Added `e.cancelBubble = true` to prevent viewport drift
**PR #6:** Had to manually handle cursor tracking because bubbling was blocked

**Pattern:**
```typescript
const handleEvent = (e) => {
  e.cancelBubble = true  // Stops propagation

  // Must manually handle ALL side effects that would normally bubble:
  handleSideEffect1()  // e.g., cursor tracking
  handleSideEffect2()  // e.g., analytics
  handleSideEffect3()  // e.g., state updates
}
```

**Rule:** When you prevent bubbling, you own ALL the side effects.

---

### 2. Optimistic Updates Are Non-Negotiable

**Lesson:** In real-time collaborative apps, optimistic updates are required, not optional.

**Without optimistic updates:**
- 50-200ms lag on every action
- Feels sluggish and unresponsive
- Users blame your app, not their network

**With optimistic updates:**
- 0ms perceived latency
- Feels instant and snappy
- Network issues invisible to user

**Implementation Cost:** Medium (local state management)
**User Experience Improvement:** Massive

---

### 3. Throttling Is About Finding Balance

**Lesson:** Too frequent = wasteful, too slow = choppy. Test to find the sweet spot.

**Experimentation:**
- 16ms (60/sec): No visible benefit over 50ms, 3x more writes
- 50ms (20/sec): Smooth sync, good cost savings ✅
- 100ms (10/sec): Slightly choppy for fast drags
- 200ms (5/sec): Too choppy

**Sweet Spot:** 50ms (20 updates/sec) balances smoothness and efficiency.

---

### 4. TDD Catches Integration Issues Early

**Lesson:** Writing tests first forces you to think about the API contract.

**Example:** When writing hit testing tests, we realized we needed:
- Edge case handling (corners, boundaries)
- Negative coordinate support
- Clear function signature

These would have been afterthoughts without TDD.

---

### 5. Final Write Guarantees Are Critical

**Lesson:** Throttling can drop updates, so always send a final guaranteed write.

**Scenario:**
1. User drags shape rapidly
2. Throttled writes send updates at 50ms intervals
3. User releases mouse at 47ms mark
4. Last throttled update was at 0ms
5. Without final write, last 47ms of movement lost!

**Solution:**
```typescript
onDragEnd: async (x, y) => {
  await updateShape(shapeId, { x, y })  // Not throttled!
}
```

---

## Future Improvements

### 1. Conflict Resolution UI

**Current:** Last write wins (silent)

**Proposed:** Show visual indicator when conflict occurs

```typescript
// User A drags shape
// User B drags same shape (conflict!)
// Show toast: "Shape updated by Bob"
```

---

### 2. Predictive Sync

**Current:** Sync every 50ms during drag

**Proposed:** Predict final position, reduce updates further

```typescript
// Use velocity/acceleration to predict final position
// Only sync when prediction changes significantly
```

---

### 3. Offline Support

**Current:** Requires network connection

**Proposed:** Queue Firestore writes, sync when online

```typescript
// Store failed writes in IndexedDB
// Retry when connection restored
```

---

### 4. Performance Monitoring

**Current:** No metrics collection

**Proposed:** Track drag performance in production

```typescript
// Monitor:
// - Firestore write latency
// - UI frame rate during drag
// - Conflict frequency
// - User-reported lag
```

---
