## Executive Summary

Transformed Canvisia from a single-canvas application to a multi-project collaborative platform similar to Figma. Users can now create multiple projects, each containing multiple canvases (pages), with granular permission controls and real-time collaboration features.

### Key Capabilities
- ✅ Multiple projects per user
- ✅ Multiple canvases (pages) per project
- ✅ Project-level sharing with role-based permissions (Owner, Editor, Viewer)
- ✅ URL-based sharing with `/p/:projectId/:canvasId` structure
- ✅ Real-time collaboration per canvas (presence, cursors, live updates)
- ✅ Email invitation system with Cloud Functions
- ✅ Projects page with tabs: Recently viewed, Shared with me, Owned by me
- ✅ Canvas sidebar navigation within projects

---

## Feature Overview

### 1. Projects Page

**Location:** `/projects` (default route after login)

**Functionality:**
- Central hub for all user projects
- Three-tab navigation:
  - **Recently viewed:** Projects sorted by last access time
  - **Shared with me:** Projects where user is a collaborator
  - **Owned by me:** Projects owned by the user
- Project cards display:
  - Project name (editable inline)
  - Last modified timestamp
  - Owner information (for shared projects)
  - Thumbnail preview (future enhancement)
- Empty state with "Create Project" call-to-action
- Search/filter functionality for projects (future enhancement)

**New Project Creation:**
1. Click "New Project" button
2. Project created with name "Untitled Project"
3. First canvas "Page 1" auto-created
4. Owner permission document created
5. Auto-navigate to `/p/{projectId}`
6. Project name editable from header

**Implementation Files:**
- `src/pages/ProjectsPage.tsx`
- `src/pages/ProjectsPage.css`
- `src/hooks/useProjects.ts`
- `src/services/projectService.ts`

---

### 2. Multi-Canvas System

**Architecture:**
- 1 Project → Multiple Canvases
- Each canvas has independent:
  - Firestore objects collection
  - RTDB presence/cursors data
  - Viewport state
  - Settings (background color, grid)

**Canvas Sidebar:**
- Collapsible left sidebar (~240px when open)
- Lists all canvases in project
- Canvas list items show:
  - Canvas name (editable inline via double-click)
  - Order position
  - Active state highlighting
  - Thumbnail preview (future enhancement)
- "+ New Canvas" button
- Context menu (right-click):
  - Rename
  - Duplicate (future)
  - Delete (with confirmation)

**Canvas Navigation:**
- Click canvas in sidebar → navigate to `/p/{projectId}/{canvasId}`
- URL-based routing enables:
  - Direct links to specific canvases
  - Browser back/forward support
  - Bookmarking specific canvases

**Canvas Creation:**
1. Click "+ New Canvas" button
2. Canvas created with auto-numbered name ("Page 2", "Page 3", etc.)
3. Order set to last position + 1
4. Auto-navigate to new canvas

**Implementation Files:**
- `src/components/canvas/CanvasSidebar.tsx`
- `src/components/canvas/CanvasSidebar.css`
- `src/services/canvasService.ts`
- `src/hooks/useCanvases.ts`

---

### 3. Permission System

**Permission Model:**
- Project-level permissions (not canvas-level)
- Three roles with distinct capabilities:

#### Owner
- Full control over project
- Can edit all canvases
- Can share project and manage collaborators
- Can change roles of other users
- Can delete project
- Can transfer ownership (future)

#### Editor
- Can edit all canvases
- Can create/delete canvases
- Can see all collaborators
- Cannot share project
- Cannot delete project
- Cannot change permissions

#### Viewer
- Read-only access to all canvases
- Can see collaborators
- Can view live cursors and presence
- Cannot edit anything
- Cannot create/delete canvases
- Cannot share or manage permissions

**Permission Storage:**
- Firestore collection: `permissions/{projectId}_{userId}`
- Documents contain:
  - `projectId`: Reference to project
  - `userId`: User's Firebase UID
  - `userEmail`: User's email address
  - `role`: 'owner' | 'editor' | 'viewer'
  - `invitedBy`: UID of user who sent invitation
  - `invitedAt`: Timestamp of invitation
  - `acceptedAt`: Timestamp when user accepted (null if pending)

**Implementation Files:**
- `src/services/permissionService.ts`
- `src/hooks/usePermissions.ts`
- `firestore.rules` (security rules)

---

### 4. Sharing System

**Share Dialog:**
- Accessible from:
  - Project card context menu
  - Header button when viewing project (purple share icon)
- Modal contains:
  1. **Shareable Link Section:**
     - Copy link button (copies `/p/{projectId}` URL)
     - Visual feedback: "Copied!" state
  2. **Invite by Email Section:**
     - Email input field
     - Role selector dropdown (Viewer/Editor/Owner)
     - "Send Invite" button
  3. **Current Collaborators List:**
     - Displays all users with access
     - Shows avatar, email, role
     - Owner can change roles via dropdown
     - Owner can remove collaborators (except self)

**Invitation Flow:**
1. Owner enters collaborator email + role
2. Click "Send Invite"
3. Permission document created in Firestore
4. Cloud Function triggered to send email notification
5. Email contains:
   - Project name
   - Inviter name
   - Direct link to project
   - Role information
6. Recipient clicks link → logs in → sees project in "Shared with me"

**Email Notifications:**
- Sent via Firebase Cloud Functions
- Template includes:
  - Personalized greeting
  - Project details
  - Call-to-action link
  - Role explanation
- Uses SendGrid for email delivery (configurable)

**Implementation Files:**
- `src/components/share/ShareDialog.tsx`
- `src/components/share/ShareDialog.css`
- `functions/src/index.ts` (Cloud Function: sendProjectInviteEmail)
- `functions/src/email/templates.ts`

---

### 5. URL Structure & Routing

**Route Definitions:**
```
/projects                    → Projects list page
/p/:projectId                → Opens project (defaults to first canvas)
/p/:projectId/:canvasId      → Opens specific canvas in project
```

**Navigation Flow:**
1. Login → redirect to `/projects`
2. Click project card → navigate to `/p/{projectId}` (loads first canvas)
3. Click canvas in sidebar → navigate to `/p/{projectId}/{canvasId}`
4. Browser back/forward works naturally
5. Direct URL sharing works: `/p/abc123/page-5` opens exact canvas

**Route Guards:**
- Check authentication status
- Check project permissions
- Redirect to 404 if project not found
- Redirect to first canvas if invalid canvasId
- Show "Access Denied" if no permission

**Implementation Files:**
- `src/App.tsx` (route configuration)
- `src/pages/ProjectView.tsx` (project wrapper component)
- `src/components/canvas/Canvas.tsx` (updated to use projectId/canvasId from URL)

---

### 6. Data Model

### Firestore Structure

```
projects/{projectId}
  - id: string
  - name: string
  - ownerId: string
  - thumbnail: string | null
  - createdAt: Timestamp
  - lastModified: Timestamp
  - lastAccessed: Timestamp

projects/{projectId}/canvases/{canvasId}
  - id: string
  - name: string
  - order: number
  - thumbnail: string | null
  - settings: {
      backgroundColor: string
      gridEnabled: boolean
    }
  - createdAt: Timestamp
  - lastModified: Timestamp

projects/{projectId}/canvases/{canvasId}/objects/{objectId}
  - (existing Shape structure - unchanged)
  - type: string
  - position: {x, y}
  - size: {width, height}
  - color: string
  - ... (all existing shape properties)

permissions/{projectId}_{userId}
  - projectId: string
  - userId: string
  - userEmail: string
  - role: 'owner' | 'editor' | 'viewer'
  - invitedBy: string
  - invitedAt: Timestamp
  - acceptedAt: Timestamp | null
```

### RTDB Structure

```
live-positions/{canvasId}/{shapeId}
  - (unchanged from original system)
  - x: number
  - y: number
  - timestamp: number

cursors/{canvasId}/{userId}
  - x: number
  - y: number
  - timestamp: number
  - userName: string
  - color: string

presence/{canvasId}/{userId}
  - userId: string
  - userName: string
  - userEmail: string
  - color: string
  - timestamp: number
  - isOnline: boolean
```

**Note:** RTDB data is scoped per canvas. Each canvas maintains independent real-time collaboration state.

### 7. Firebase Security Rules

### Firestore Rules

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {

    // Helper functions
    function isAuthenticated() {
      return request.auth != null;
    }

    function hasPermission(projectId, requiredRole) {
      let permDoc = get(/databases/$(database)/documents/permissions/$(projectId + '_' + request.auth.uid));
      return permDoc != null && permDoc.data.role == requiredRole;
    }

    function hasAnyPermission(projectId) {
      return exists(/databases/$(database)/documents/permissions/$(projectId + '_' + request.auth.uid));
    }

    function isOwner(projectId) {
      return hasPermission(projectId, 'owner');
    }

    function canEdit(projectId) {
      return hasPermission(projectId, 'owner') || hasPermission(projectId, 'editor');
    }

    // Projects collection
    match /projects/{projectId} {
      allow read: if isAuthenticated() && hasAnyPermission(projectId);
      allow create: if isAuthenticated() && request.resource.data.ownerId == request.auth.uid;
      allow update: if isAuthenticated() && canEdit(projectId);
      allow delete: if isAuthenticated() && isOwner(projectId);

      // Canvases subcollection
      match /canvases/{canvasId} {
        allow read: if isAuthenticated() && hasAnyPermission(projectId);
        allow write: if isAuthenticated() && canEdit(projectId);

        // Objects subcollection
        match /objects/{objectId} {
          allow read: if isAuthenticated() && hasAnyPermission(projectId);
          allow write: if isAuthenticated() && canEdit(projectId);
        }
      }
    }

    // Permissions collection
    match /permissions/{permissionId} {
      // Users can read their own permissions
      allow read: if isAuthenticated() &&
                     permissionId.matches('.*_' + request.auth.uid);

      // Only project owner can create/update/delete permissions
      allow create, update, delete: if isAuthenticated() &&
                                      isOwner(resource.data.projectId);
    }
  }
}
```

### RTDB Rules

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "live-positions": {
      "$canvasId": {
        ".read": "auth != null",
        ".write": "auth != null"
      }
    },
    "cursors": {
      "$canvasId": {
        "$userId": {
          ".read": "auth != null",
          ".write": "auth != null && auth.uid == $userId"
        }
      }
    },
    "presence": {
      "$canvasId": {
        "$userId": {
          ".read": "auth != null",
          ".write": "auth != null && auth.uid == $userId"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 8. Header Component Updates

**Header Display Modes:**

**Projects Page Mode:**
- Shows "Canvisia" logo in purple (#8B5CF6)
- User avatar and sign out button
- No project-specific controls

**Project View Mode:**
- Shows project name (editable via click)
- "Back to projects" button (purple hover: #EDE9FE)
- Share button with purple hover (#8B5CF6)
- Active users presence indicator
- User avatar and sign out button (purple: #8B5CF6)

**Implementation Files:**
- `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`
- `src/components/ui/Tooltip.tsx` (custom tooltip component)
- `src/components/ui/Tooltip.css`

---

### 9. Real-Time Collaboration

**Canvas-Scoped Collaboration:**
- Each canvas maintains independent real-time state
- When switching canvases:
  1. Unsubscribe from old canvas RTDB listeners
  2. Subscribe to new canvas RTDB data
  3. Update presence to new canvas
  4. Cursors and live positions specific to current canvas

**Presence System:**
- Tracks active users per canvas
- Displays in header with count and colored avatars
- Auto-cleanup on disconnect (RTDB `.onDisconnect()`)
- Color assignment per user (consistent across canvases)

**Live Cursors:**
- Real-time cursor positions for all users on canvas
- Throttled updates (60 FPS max)
- Shows user name label on hover
- Color-coded per user

**Live Object Updates:**
- Shape positions sync in real-time during drag
- Throttled to 60 FPS for performance
- RTDB for position, Firestore for final state

**Implementation Files:**
- `src/hooks/usePresence.ts`
- `src/hooks/useCursors.ts`
- `src/hooks/useLivePositions.ts`
- `src/components/canvas/Canvas.tsx`

---

### 10. Migration Strategy

**Approach:** Archive existing "default-canvas"

**Old Data:**
- `canvases/default-canvas/objects` collection remains in Firestore
- Not displayed in new UI
- Preserved for potential future import feature
- No automatic migration or data transfer

**First Login Experience:**
1. User logs in after deployment
2. Redirected to `/projects`
3. Empty projects page shown
4. User creates first project manually
5. Clean slate for new multi-project workflow

**Data Preservation:**
- Old canvas data is NOT deleted
- Can be accessed manually via Firestore console
- Future "Import from legacy canvas" feature possible
- Ensures no data loss during transition

---

## Technical Implementation Details

### State Management

**Project-Level State:**
- Managed in `ProjectView.tsx`
- Contains project metadata, canvas list
- Real-time subscription to project document
- Canvas list sorted by `order` field

**Canvas-Level State:**
- Managed in `Canvas.tsx` (existing component)
- Contains shapes, viewport, selection
- Real-time subscription to canvas objects
- Independent per canvas (unmounts on navigation)

**Global State:**
- Authentication state in `AuthProvider`
- User profile and preferences
- Active project/canvas IDs

### Performance Optimizations

**Data Loading:**
- Lazy load canvases (only load current canvas objects)
- Pagination for project cards (future)
- Debounced search/filter (future)
- Optimistic updates for instant UI feedback

**Real-Time Subscriptions:**
- Unsubscribe from old canvas on navigation
- Single subscription per canvas (not per shape)
- Batch updates to minimize re-renders
- React.memo for shape components

**Rendering:**
- Virtual scrolling for large canvas lists (future)
- Thumbnail generation offloaded to Cloud Functions (future)
- Viewport culling for off-screen shapes
- RequestAnimationFrame for cursor updates

1. **Maintains backward compatibility** - Old canvas data preserved
2. **Enables collaboration** - Project sharing with granular permissions
3. **Scales efficiently** - Canvas-scoped real-time data, lazy loading
4. **Provides intuitive UX** - Clear navigation, consistent purple theme
5. **Ensures security** - Firestore rules enforce permission model
6. **Sets foundation for growth** - Extensible architecture for future features

The feature is production-ready pending full validation testing. The purple theming and tooltip improvements enhance brand consistency and user experience. Future phases will build on this foundation to add thumbnails, templates, version history, and team workspaces.

**Status:** ✅ Ready for validation and production deployment
