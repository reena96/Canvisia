## Bugs & Fixes

### 1. Viewport Moves When Dragging Shapes

**Issue:**
When dragging a shape, the entire canvas viewport would also move in the same direction, creating a confusing double-movement effect.

**Root Cause:**
Shape drag events were bubbling up to the Stage component, which also had `draggable={true}`. Both the shape AND the Stage were responding to the same drag event.

**Fix:**
Added `e.cancelBubble = true` to prevent event bubbling in ShapeRenderer:

```typescript
const handleDragStart = (e: any) => {
  e.cancelBubble = true // Prevent Stage from dragging
}

const handleDragMove = (e: any) => {
  e.cancelBubble = true // Prevent Stage drag during shape drag
}

const handleDragEnd = (e: any) => {
  e.cancelBubble = true // Prevent event from bubbling to Stage
  const node = e.target
  onDragEnd?.(node.x(), node.y())
}
```

**File:** `src/components/canvas/ShapeRenderer.tsx:18-24`

**Lesson:** Always prevent event bubbling when child and parent components both handle the same event type (drag, click, etc.).

### 2. Color Mismatch Between Dev Login and Shapes

**Issue:**
User colors shown on dev login buttons (Alice=Red, Bob=Teal, Charlie=Blue) didn't match cursor and shape colors, which were generated via hash of userId.

**Root Cause:**
Three separate color definitions in three different files:
1. `DevLogin.tsx` - hardcoded colors in TEST_USERS array
2. `Canvas.tsx` - `getUserColor(userId)` function using hash algorithm
3. `seed-emulator-users.ts` - displayNames were "Alice Test", "Bob Test" (didn't match lookup)

**Fix:**
Created single source of truth in `src/config/userColors.ts`:

```typescript
export const DEV_USER_COLORS: UserColorConfig[] = [
  { displayName: 'Alice', color: '#FF6B6B' },  // Red
  { displayName: 'Bob', color: '#4ECDC4' },    // Teal
  { displayName: 'Charlie', color: '#45B7D1' } // Blue
]

export function getUserColor(userName: string): string {
  const devUser = DEV_USER_COLORS.find((u) => u.displayName === userName)
  if (devUser) return devUser.color
  // Fallback to hash-based color for non-dev users
}
```

Then updated:
- `DevLogin.tsx` - imports DEV_USER_COLORS
- `Canvas.tsx` - imports getUserColor, passes `userName` instead of `userId`
- `seed-emulator-users.ts` - changed displayNames from "Alice Test" to "Alice"

**Lesson:** When multiple components need the same data, create a shared configuration file. Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

### 3. Java Runtime Not Found for Firebase Emulators

**Issue:**
`Error: Process 'java -version' has exited with code 1. Unable to locate a Java Runtime.`

**Root Cause:**
Firebase emulators require Java, but it wasn't installed or not in PATH.

**Fix:**
1. Installed OpenJDK 21: `brew install openjdk@21`
2. Added to PATH in `~/.zshrc`:
   ```bash
   export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@21/bin:$PATH"
   ```
3. Added to `scripts/dev.sh` for automation:
   ```bash
   export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@21/bin:$PATH"
   ```

**Lesson:** Document system dependencies and automate their configuration in development scripts.

---

### 4. Firebase Emulator Port Conflicts

**Issue:**
`Error: Could not start Emulator UI, port taken.` Ports 4000, 8080, 9000, 9099 already in use from previous runs.

**Root Cause:**
Multiple Firebase emulator processes running in background from previous development sessions.

**Fix:**
Added automatic cleanup to `scripts/dev.sh`:

```bash
if pgrep -f "firebase.*emulators" > /dev/null; then
  echo "Stopping existing Firebase emulators..."
  pkill -f "firebase.*emulators"
  sleep 2
fi

if pgrep -f "vite.*dev" > /dev/null; then
  echo "Stopping existing Vite dev server..."
  pkill -f "vite.*dev"
  sleep 2
fi
```

**Lesson:** Development scripts should handle cleanup of stale processes before starting new ones.

---

### 5. Test Users Not Seeded in Emulator

**Issue:**
`Firebase: Error (auth/user-not-found)` when using dev login buttons (Alice, Bob, Charlie).

**Root Cause:**
Firebase Auth emulator starts with empty user database. Test users weren't automatically created.

**Fix:**
Integrated user seeding into `scripts/dev.sh`:

```bash
echo "👥 Seeding test users (Alice, Bob, Charlie)..."
npm run seed-users > /dev/null 2>&1
```

Now `npm run dev:full` automatically:
1. Cleans up old processes
2. Starts Firebase emulators
3. Seeds test users
4. Starts Vite dev server

**Lesson:** Automate all setup steps in the development workflow to reduce friction and human error.

## Design Decisions

### 1. Collaborative Editing Model

**Decision:** Allow any authenticated user to edit any shape (Figma-style).

**Rationale:**
- Standard for collaborative design tools (Figma, Miro, FigJam)
- Encourages team collaboration without artificial barriers
- The `createdBy` field still tracks original creator for visual identification via colors

**Firestore Rules:**
```javascript
// Any authenticated user can edit any shape
allow update: if request.auth != null;

// Any authenticated user can delete any shape
allow delete: if request.auth != null;
```

**Alternative Considered:** Creator-only editing (rejected as too restrictive for collaborative whiteboard).

---

### 2. Shape Color Coding

**Decision:** Shapes inherit creator's cursor color.

**Rationale:**
- Visual indication of who created what
- Consistent with cursor colors already implemented
- Easy identification during collaborative sessions

**Implementation:**
```typescript
const userColor = getUserColor(userName)
const newRect = createDefaultRectangle(x, y, userId, userColor)
```

---

### 3. Test-Driven Development (TDD)

**Decision:** Write tests BEFORE implementation code.

**Approach:**
1. **RED:** Write failing test (`tests/unit/shapeDefaults.test.ts`)
2. **GREEN:** Write minimal code to pass (`src/utils/shapeDefaults.ts`)
3. **REFACTOR:** Clean up code while keeping tests green

**Example:**
```typescript
// STEP 1: Write test first
it('should create rectangle with correct position', () => {
  const rect = createDefaultRectangle(100, 200)
  expect(rect.x).toBe(100)
  expect(rect.y).toBe(200)
})

// STEP 2: Implement minimal code to pass
export function createDefaultRectangle(x: number, y: number): Rectangle {
  return { id: crypto.randomUUID(), type: 'rectangle', x, y, ... }
}
```

**Result:** All 53 tests passing throughout PR #5 development.

## Architecture Patterns

### 1. Custom Hooks for Data Management

**Pattern:** Separate data fetching logic from UI components.

**useFirestore Hook:**
```typescript
export function useFirestore(canvasId: string) {
  const [shapes, setShapes] = useState<Shape[]>([])
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true)
  const [error, setError] = useState<Error | null>(null)

  useEffect(() => {
    const unsubscribe = subscribeToShapes(canvasId, setShapes)
    return () => unsubscribe()
  }, [canvasId])

  return { shapes, loading, error, createShape, updateShape, deleteShape }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Reusable across components
- Automatic cleanup via useEffect return
- Centralized error handling
- Real-time updates via Firestore onSnapshot

---

### 2. Service Layer Pattern

**Pattern:** Separate business logic from React hooks.

**Structure:**
```
src/services/firestore.ts  ← Core Firestore operations (CRUD)
src/hooks/useFirestore.ts  ← React integration (state, effects, cleanup)
src/components/canvas/Canvas.tsx ← UI layer (rendering, events)
```

**Benefits:**
- Services can be tested independently
- Hooks can be swapped without changing services
- Clear separation of concerns

---

### 3. Discriminated Unions for Shape Types

**Pattern:** TypeScript discriminated unions with type guards.

```typescript
export type Shape = Rectangle | Circle | Line | Text

export interface Rectangle extends BaseShape {
  type: 'rectangle'  // ← Discriminant
  width: number
  height: number
}

// Type guard
function isRectangle(shape: Shape): shape is Rectangle {
  return shape.type === 'rectangle'
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Type-safe shape rendering
- Compiler ensures exhaustive switch cases
- Easy to add new shape types

---

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Real-Time Sync Throttling

**Implementation:**
- Cursor updates: Throttled to 50ms (in PR #4)
- Shape updates: Immediate (user-initiated, less frequent)

**Rationale:**
- Cursor moves constantly → needs throttling
- Shape drags are user-initiated → immediate feedback preferred

---

### 2. Event Bubbling Prevention

**Pattern:** Stop propagation at lowest level to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

```typescript
const handleDragStart = (e: any) => {
  e.cancelBubble = true  // Prevents Stage from processing event
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduces event handling overhead
- Prevents unwanted side effects
- Improves UX (no viewport drift)

---

## Testing Strategies

### 1. Unit Tests for Pure Functions

**Example:** `tests/unit/shapeDefaults.test.ts`

```typescript
describe('createDefaultRectangle', () => {
  it('should generate unique IDs', () => {
    const rect1 = createDefaultRectangle(0, 0)
    const rect2 = createDefaultRectangle(0, 0)
    expect(rect1.id).not.toBe(rect2.id)
  })
})
```

**Coverage:** All utility functions (shape creation, canvas math, auth helpers)

---

### 2. Integration Tests for Firestore

**Note:** Actual Firestore integration tests were deferred to manual testing.

**Manual Test Checklist:**
- [ ] Alice creates rectangle → Bob sees it (< 100ms)
- [ ] Bob drags Alice's rectangle → syncs in real-time
- [ ] Refresh page → shapes persist
- [ ] Shapes match creator cursor colors

---

## Development Workflow Improvements

### 1. One-Command Startup

**Before:**
```bash
# Terminal 1
firebase emulators:start

# Terminal 2
npm run seed-users

# Terminal 3
npm run dev
```

**After:**
```bash
npm run dev:full  # Does everything automatically
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduced onboarding friction
- Fewer steps to remember
- Consistent environment setup

---

### 2. Automated Test User Creation

**Pattern:** Seed database as part of startup script.

```bash
# In scripts/dev.sh
npm run seed-users > /dev/null 2>&1
```

**Benefits:**
- No manual user creation
- Consistent test data
- Faster development iteration

---

## Firestore Best Practices

### 1. Timestamp Conversion

**Issue:** JavaScript Date vs Firestore Timestamp incompatibility.

**Solution:**
```typescript
// Writing to Firestore
const shapeData = {
  ...shape,
  updatedAt: Timestamp.fromDate(new Date(shape.updatedAt))
}

// Reading from Firestore
const shape = {
  ...data,
  updatedAt: data.updatedAt?.toDate?.()?.toISOString() || data.updatedAt
}
```

---

### 2. Security Rules

**Pattern:** Server-side validation, client-side feedback.

```javascript
// Only creator can set createdBy to their own uid
allow create: if request.auth != null
              && request.resource.data.createdBy == request.auth.uid;

// Any authenticated user can update (collaborative editing)
allow update: if request.auth != null;
```

**Lesson:** Security rules are the source of truth. UI permissions are for UX only.

---

### 3. Real-Time Subscriptions

**Pattern:** Subscribe in useEffect, cleanup on unmount.

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const unsubscribe = subscribeToShapes(canvasId, (shapes) => {
    setShapes(shapes)
    setLoading(false)
  })

  return () => unsubscribe()  // Cleanup prevents memory leaks
}, [canvasId])
```

---

## Git Workflow

### 1. Commit Strategy

**Pattern:** Logical, atomic commits with descriptive messages.

**Examples from PR #5:**
```

4007704 PR #5 (Part 2): Add Firestore sync and real-time collaboration
3a3a016 PR #5: Add creator color coding for shapes
6f627a6 Match dev login colors with cursor and shape colors
bffbfe0 Enable full collaborative editing for all users
```

**Format:**
```
<type>: <short description>

<detailed explanation>
<why this change was needed>
<what alternatives were considered>

---

### 2. Merge Strategy

**Decision:** No-fast-forward merges (`--no-ff`) to preserve branch history.

```bash
git merge feature/object-sync --no-ff
```

**Benefits:**
- Clear feature boundaries in git log
- Easy to revert entire feature if needed
- Better understanding of project evolution

## Future Improvements

### 1. Optimistic Updates

**Current:** Updates wait for Firestore confirmation.

**Proposed:** Update local state immediately, rollback on error.

```typescript
// Optimistic update
setShapes(shapes.map(s => s.id === id ? { ...s, x, y } : s))

// Sync to Firestore
try {
  await updateShape(id, { x, y })
} catch (error) {
  // Rollback on error
  setShapes(originalShapes)
}
```

---

### 2. Conflict Resolution

**Current:** Last write wins.

**Proposed:** Operational Transformation (OT) or CRDT for concurrent edits.

**Example Conflict:**
1. Alice moves shape to (100, 100)
2. Bob moves shape to (200, 200) at same time
3. Who wins? Currently: whoever writes to Firestore last

---

### 3. Shape Deletion

**Current:** No delete functionality.

**TODO:**
- Add Delete key handler
- Add "Delete" button in toolbar
- Implement soft delete (archive instead of hard delete)

---

### 4. Undo/Redo

**Current:** No history tracking.

**Proposed:** Command pattern with history stack.

```typescript
interface Command {
  execute(): void
  undo(): void
}

class MoveShapeCommand implements Command {
  execute() { /* move shape */ }
  undo() { /* restore original position */ }
}
```
